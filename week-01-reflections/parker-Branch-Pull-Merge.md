# What is main?
[I like to think of the main or master as the tree truck that holds the main information.]

[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 1]
# Why create a branch?
[The branch allows you to work with other team members. Once I create a branch, I could make changes - adjustments, additional detail on my branch without changing the core detail on the main/master]


# Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?


[The concepts learnt are not difficult to understand and i am learning the terminlogy slowly. Although it takes time to put the theory into practice as I need to refer to the videos more than once to build my confidence and take risks when working through the course.
