# How would you describe the stage and commit to your non-tech savvy friends?
[Within the Git work flow git allows you to add files to the staging area. Once you are happy with the content  you will commit the details.]

# What is commit

[Commit is a snapshot of your repository. You commit the changes made. Each commit is saved so you can return to the repository if you need to refer to a previous commit. I refer commit as a save button.]
