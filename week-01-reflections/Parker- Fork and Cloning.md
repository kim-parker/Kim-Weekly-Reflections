# What are some examples of when you would fork?  



[Fork allows you to select and use a public file on Github that you are able to manipulate although you will not overwrite the original file on Github. This would work very well when you are working as a group and team members collaborate and create their own project that will not overwrite the original. I think it would allow members to see each of the projects before a final decision is made.

# What is Cloning?
[Once you have forked the file, you are able to clone the contents or files. The files will stay in your local directory so you can amend, update or add files. The clones will not update the Fork you created on Github until you stage, commit and push the changes. The changes will be made on Github.]


# Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
[The concept was easy to understand and I was able to add my reflections with ease on Visual Code. The trickiest part was to navigate github to locate the reflections repo. After many attempts I went on discord for help and two students were able to assist me quickly and I was able to progress further. This is something I need to do more often as I find myself stuck and persevere to find solutions to the problems. I was able to fork and clone without issues and I understand the reasons to fork and clone. It makes sense that each reflection will go through the workflow process, stage, commit and push to see the changes on the Github server.]
