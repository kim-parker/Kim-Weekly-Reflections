# What is Fork?  



[Fork allows you to select and use a public file on Github that you are able to manipulate although you will not overwrite the original file on Githubplace your questions/answers here, and delete this line]

# What is Cloning?
[Once you have forked the file, you are able to clone the contents or files. The files will stay in your local directory so you can amend, update or add files. The clones will not update the Fork you created on Github until you stage, commit and push the changes. The changes will be made on Github.]


# What did you find challenging?
[The concept was easy to understand and I was able to add my reflections with ease on Visual Code. The trickiest part was to navigate github to locate the reflections repo. After many attempts I went on discord for help and two students were able to assist me quickly and I was able to progress further. This is something I need to do more often as I find myself stuck and persevere to find solutions to the problems.]
