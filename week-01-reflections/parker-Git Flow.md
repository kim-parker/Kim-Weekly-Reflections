# What is a Git workflow?




[A git flow will involve branching (sometimes multiple branches) and allows teams to work independently and make changes regularly. It allows teams to work freely and make regular commits with changes made.

# What did you notice about your learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked??



[When I was stuck I would refer to Josephâ€™s tutorial which helped immensely. On most occasions I would go to the command line and back track my steps, this allowed me to check the steps that were successful. Silly input errors were caused when I mis-typed a symbol or key.   I used my personal notes to help me when I got stuck or received error messages. Often I would leave the error messages and take a break. This was also sometimes successful as I would see the error with a fresh pair of eyes and see the error I had made. Watching the videos also assisted to get a clearer understanding when an error had been made.]




# Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration?



[Yes, I would not need to read all the notes again which would speed up the steps and also gain more confidence in using the codes, software and solving errors.
