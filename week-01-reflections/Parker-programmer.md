# What is your process so far for solving problems



[So far my problem solving skills are certainly mixed. Initially, I was trying to look at the whole problem rather than breaking it down in small pieces and I felt quite overwhelmed. I have had to rethink and reconsider the problem in a different way. I feel I have begun to look at the activities in smaller pieces. I understand the concepts that have been taught in Sprint one although putting them into practice is sometimes tricky. It has helped to take notes/diagrams so it reconfirms the concept I have learnt so I can refer to them if I need assistance. 

Initially I would be irratiated/frustrated when I receive an error in the coding but I have come to realise that I am receiving more pratise at problem solving but relooking at my coding (degugging)and reread my notes or check the tutorials. Each time I make a mistake I feel that it is helping me to remember the process used within git and the codes too. Google and Discord help request has assisted me when I have been stuck. 

It has helped me to take a break from the computer if I was unable to resolve the error and reapproach the problem differently (refactoring. As my confidence builds I am looking to use the Toggle app to help with Time box as unfortunately I am taking much longer than the task indicates. I have felt a sense of achievement when I have found a solution to a problem or error and believe that I am one step closer to completing the activity.
