# How would you describe the command line in plain English in a couple of sentences?




[The key information to remember is that the Terminal screen is referred to as the Remote screen and directories on Windows Explorer are referred to as the Local screen. The command line actions simultaneously the changes in the windows/directory  screen. Using the command line will allow you to create, delete and navigate using the terminal screen. 
I was unable to stick to the timebox as I needed to refer to the Dev Academy Foundations: Sprint 1 Workshop many times to confirm that I was able to remember the codes and take notes which helped me enormously. I had to troubleshoot many times and then realized that I needed to download the Git Bash programme so I could follow the lesson with Joseph.
The 40 minute session was a little overwhelming so I concentrated on the command line only as advised. Following this activity I am feeling a little comfortable as I spent many hours yesterday problem solving. I realize I need to seek help from experts in the cohort to assist me.]


# Name the five command lines you learnt and what they do?
[ Five main codes I have learnt and actions are the following
ls - to list
mkdir another_directory - Create folder
cd .. to jump out of a directory 
rm -rf - to delete a directory
cd workspace - to locate a directory]

# Did you learn anything unexpected

[Everything I have learnt so far is totally new to me and it makes me feel very uncomfortable as I know many of the students are very experienced in coding. The shortcuts for the command line Joseph mentioned in the video were very useful.
