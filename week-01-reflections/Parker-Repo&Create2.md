# When did you feel frustrated?


[I did not feel frustrated with this activity as I referred to my notes from the clone session I completed yesterday. The tech tutorial is a great 
resource to go to. I am currently building my self-confidence each time i build on new learning and try new concepts.]
# If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

[I was quite surprised at how easy it was to start a website and felt some self satisfaction that I would complete the early stages of a website. I did not have a clue how websites are build with programming so I did not have any premisconceptions.]
